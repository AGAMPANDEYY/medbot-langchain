Based on the provided context and textbook, I am not certain about the exact cause of your abdominal pain with irregular periods. 

However, considering your symptoms (abdominal pain and irregular periods), it is essential to consult a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment. In the meantime, here are some general guidelines:

*   If you experience severe or persistent abdominal pain, seek medical attention immediately.
*   Irregular periods can be caused by various factors, including hormonal imbalances, stress, or underlying medical conditions such as endometriosis, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), or fibroids.

To address your symptoms, it would be best to schedule an appointment with your primary care physician or a gynecologist. They can perform a physical examination, take a detailed medical history, and may order diagnostic tests such as a pelvic exam, blood work, or imaging studies (e.g., ultrasound) to determine the underlying cause of your symptoms.

Some possible causes of abdominal pain and irregular periods include:

*   Endometriosis: A condition where tissue similar to the lining inside the uterus grows outside the uterus, leading to inflammation, scarring, and adhesions.
*   Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS): A hormonal disorder characterized by infrequent or prolonged menstrual periods, excess hair growth, and acne.
*   Fibroids: Benign tumors that grow in the uterus and can cause pain, bleeding, and other symptoms.

In addition to seeking medical attention, you may also consider making lifestyle changes such as:

*   Maintaining a healthy weight
*   Exercising regularly
*   Eating a balanced diet
*   Managing stress through relaxation techniques

However, it is crucial to consult a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment. They can help determine the underlying cause of your symptoms and recommend the best course of action.

In conclusion, while I cannot provide a definitive answer without further evaluation, scheduling an appointment with a healthcare professional is essential to address your symptoms and determine the underlying cause.
